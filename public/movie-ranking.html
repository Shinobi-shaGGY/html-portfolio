<h2>MY TOP 3 FANTACY MOVIES</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>JONH CARTER</h3>
 <p>He acquired some form of teleportation power, which gave him the ability to become powerful on Mars due to the gravity. </p>
 <h3>GODS OF EGYPT</h3>
 <p> I wish I had magical abilities, and in this film, a normal kid aids the god, and his love for his partner is classic.</p>
 <h3>ZATHURA</h3>
 <p>This is a sort of adventure film that always takes me back to my early years. </p>
